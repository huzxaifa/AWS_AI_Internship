---PROJECT STATEMENT---
Problem Statement: Intelligent E-Commerce Ad Creative Generator with 
MLOps Pipeline 
Modern e-commerce businesses require dynamic and visually compelling 
advertisement creatives for product marketing. However, generating high-quality 
promotional content manually for thousands of products is time-consuming and 
resource-intensive. 
Your task is to design and deploy a Generative AI-powered Ad Creative 
Automation System, supported by a fully operational MLOps pipeline that ensures 
scalable deployment, monitoring, automated retraining, and continuous delivery. 
 
Project Objective 
Build a system that automatically generates marketing creatives (text and optionally 
image layout) for e-commerce products based on the product title and short 
description. The creatives should follow a standardized style and be suitable for 
social media posting. 
The 
project 
must 
demonstrate 
the 
full 
machine 
learning 
lifecycle 
with 
production-grade infrastructure built using modern MLOps practices. 
 
Core Functional Features

Description 
Data Ingestion 
Pull product metadata (name, category, description) from a 
CSV/API 
Generative Model 
Training 
Fine-tuned LLM for text creatives (e.g., T5, GPT-Neo, 
LLaMA-based small model) 
Versioning 
Track datasets and model versions using MLflow 
Model Deployment 
Containerize model inference service using Docker 
Production Deployment Deploy microservices on Cloud-based Kubernetes 
(AKS/GKE/EKS/DigitalOcean) 
Continuous 
Integration/Delivery 
Implement GitHub Actions pipeline for automated testing, 
container build, and deployment 
Monitoring 
Expose model performance and inference latency via a 
custom Prometheus exporter 

Feature 
Description 
Visualization 
Create Grafana dashboards for real-time system health 
and custom ML metrics 
Scheduling 
Use Airflow to schedule batch inferences and retraining 
workflows
